            On July 10, 2012, Richard D. Zanuck watched this documentary for the very first time. He wrote a letter to the producers that afternoon. In it he said, “I am exceedingly pleased and admittedly a little stunned. I had no idea what the interviewees had said or what film clips would be used, or really what the whole effect of this endeavor would be. It is of course something that my family and I will treasure forever.”

“”A refreshingly candid documentary of one of Hollywood’s highest profile and most successful producers.” - Stephen Schaefer, Boston Herald”
