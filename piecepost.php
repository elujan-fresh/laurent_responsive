          <p class="documentary_text">
            In a career that spanned sixty years, Alfred Hitchcock made more than fifty feature-length films and hosted his own television series, transforming the thriller genre in the twentieth century. Author Laurent Bouzereau puts this incredible canon into perspective, examining the master’s life thematically: his archetypal anti-heroes; his complicated female characters; his charming villains; and something Bouzereau calls “the Hitchcock touch” — those elements of film that are, quite simply, Hitchcockian.
